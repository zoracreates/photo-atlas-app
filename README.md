# Photo Atlas App

A cross-platform app that helps photographers collaboratively scout photography spots

## Description

Photo Atlas aims to help photographers find the best spots to take pictures, and to plan photography trips in a collaborative manner.

Photographers can spend hours looking for locations both online and on-the-go. While there are a few apps out there that can ease the scouting process, one great way to find these locations is to learn where other photographers have captured great pictures. Not many apps exist that allow photographers to get direct recommendations from other photographers. Those apps that do exist are usually small and crowdsourced, therefore containing only a handful of spots. 
 
To avoid only having a few locations, Photo Atlas aims to leverage the Flickr API to suggest photography spots. It will also allow photographers to create curated lists of photography spots, called Trips, and share these trips with the public or with a select group of photographers.
