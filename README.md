# Photo Atlas App

A cross-platform app that helps photographers scout photography spots

## Description

Photo Atlas App helps photographers find the right location to capture their best work. Its main goals are: 1) to ease the time consuming process of scouting for photo spots, and 2) to make it easy to find and share good photography spots with others. During my capstone project, I created this responsive web application by leveraging technologies such as React, the Flickr API, Firebase, Netlify, and Github. I successfully launched the application at [photoatlasapp.com](https://photoatlasapp.com/).
